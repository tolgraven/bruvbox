* make contrast modes like gruvbox but much heavier, fading fg saturation
  massively rather than just tweaking bg slightly. see screenshot of

* hue and contrast as continous slider ranges (1-10 or 1-100 or whatever)
  rather than shitty lil set values

* function to compute relative colors so can do stuff like fade out text
  while still keeping coloring
